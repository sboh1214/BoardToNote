    <li>Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

        <p> this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</p>

        <p> worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</p>

        <p> copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,</p>

        <p> publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the</p>

    <li>Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

        <p> this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</p>

        <p> worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</p>

        <p> (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,</p>

        <p> use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,</p>

        <p> where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable</p>

        <p> by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their</p>

        <p> Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)</p>

        <p> with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You</p>

        <p> institute patent litigation against any entity (including a</p>

        <p> cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work</p>

        <p> or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</p>

        <p> or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses</p>

        <p> granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</p>

        <p> as of the date such litigation is filed.</p></li>
    <li>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

        <p> Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without</p>

        <p> modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You</p>

        <p> meet the following conditions:</p>

        <p> (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or</p>

        <p> Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>

        <p> (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</p>

        <p> stating that You changed the files; and</p>

        <p> (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</p>

        <p> that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and</p>

        <p> attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,</p>

        <p> excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</p>

        <p> the Derivative Works; and</p>

        <p> (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</p>

        <p> distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</p>

        <p> include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</p>

        <p> within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</p>

        <p> pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</p>

        <p> of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</p>

        <p> as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</p>

        <p> documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</p>

        <p> within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</p>

        <p> wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</p>

        <p> of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</p>

        <p> do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</p>

        <p> notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</p>

        <p> or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</p>

        <p> that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</p>

        <p> as modifying the License.</p>

        <p> You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</p>

        <p> may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</p>

        <p> for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</p>

        <p> for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</p>

        <p> reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</p>

        <p> the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
    <li>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

        <p> any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</p>

        <p> by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</p>

        <p> this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</p>

        <p> Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</p>

        <p> the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</p>

        <p> with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p></li>
    <li>Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

        <p> names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</p>

        <p> except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</p>

        <p> origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p></li>
    <li>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

        <p> agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</p>

        <p> Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,</p>

        <p> WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</p>

        <p> implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</p>

        <p> of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</p>

        <p> PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</p>

        <p> appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</p>

        <p> risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p></li>
    <li>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

        <p> whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</p>

        <p> unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</p>

        <p> negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</p>

        <p> liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</p>

        <p> incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</p>

        <p> result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</p>

        <p> Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</p>

        <p> work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</p>

        <p> other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</p>

        <p> has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
    <li>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

        <p> the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</p>

        <p> and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</p>

        <p> or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</p>

        <p> License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</p>

        <p> on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</p>

        <p> of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</p>

        <p> defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</p>

        <p> incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</p>

        <p> of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p></li>
