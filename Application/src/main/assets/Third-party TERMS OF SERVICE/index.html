    shall be solely owned by Crashlytics (including all intellectual property rights therein and
    thereto) and shall also be Crashlytics&#39;s confidential information. Developer hereby assigns
    all of its right, title and interest in and to any Developer Feedback to Crashlytics and
    acknowledges that Crashlytics has the unrestricted right to use and exploit such Developer
    Feedback in any manner, without attribution, and without any obligations or compensation to
    Developer.</p>

<p>2.5 Developer Data. Developer hereby grants Crashlytics a nonexclusive, license fee free and
    royalty free right and license to access, copy, distribute, process and use all information,
    data and other content provided by Developer or received by Crashlytics in connection with
    Developer&#39;s authorized use of the Services, including, without limitation information
    provided through any Application or Beta Application that Developer makes available for testing
    through the Services (collectively, &quot;Developer Data&quot;), solely for the purpose of
    providing, developing, and maintaining the Services, along with any related customer or
    technical support, and as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement. Developer agrees
    that: (a) the Services depend on the availability of the Developer Data, and (b) Crashlytics
    will not assume any responsibility or liability for, or undertake to verify, the legality,
    accuracy or completeness of the Developer Data. Crashlytics shall have no obligation to store
    any Developer Data or Results (as defined below).</p>

<p>2.6 Access by Beta Testers; EULA; End Users; Compliance. Developer shall provide to Crashlytics
    the contact information of any user of Developer&#39;s application(s) whom Developer intends to
    invite to become a Beta Tester. Developer is solely responsible for determining which users will
    receive an invitation to become a Beta Tester, and for ensuring the accuracy of any user contact
    information provided to Crashlytics. Developer may provide Beta Testers with its own EULA for a
    Beta Application that will be accessed by Beta Testers (&quot;Developer EULA&quot;); provided
    that the Developer EULA provides terms and conditions consistent with this Agreement and, with
    respect to Crashlytics, no less protective than those terms and conditions set forth in the
    standard EULA provided in Appendix A (&quot;Standard EULA&quot;). If Developer does not provide
    a separate Developer EULA to Beta Testers in connection with Developer&#39;s Beta Application,
    then Developer acknowledges and agrees that such Beta Testers, by accessing the Beta Application
    through the Services, will be made subject to the terms and conditions of the Standard EULA
    between Developer and such Beta Testers. Developer acknowledges and agrees that Crashlytics
    provides the Standard EULA by way of convenience only, and does not represent or warrant that
    the Standard EULA will be enforceable under, or in compliance with, all applicable laws, rules,
    regulations, or otherwise. Developer acknowledges and agrees that the EULA applicable to
    Developer&#39;s Beta Application shall be between Developer and any Beta Tester, and Crashlytics
    shall not be responsible for, and shall not have any liability whatsoever for, such EULA, any
    application tested by a Beta Tester, or for any breach by Developer or any Beta Tester of the
    terms and conditions of such EULA. The Services allow the Developer to collect information
    relating to performance of Developer&#39;s applications, including, without limitation, device
    state information, unique device identifiers, information relating to the physical location of a
    device, and information about how the application was used. Developer may turn on features of
    the Services to allow collection of other information via the Services, including some
    personally identifiable information (e.g., a user&#39;s email address), which allows Developers
    to communicate with users about the engagement with and functionality of their applications and
    to invite them to become Beta Testers. Developer represents and warrants that Developer is
    collecting information via the Services solely to obtain information about the user engagement
    with and functionality of Developer&#39;s applications, and to communicate with users about such
    engagement and functionality. Developer agrees that it will not enable collection of personally
    identifiable information via the Services unless it is necessary to communicate with users about
    the applications or Developer wishes to invite users to be Beta Testers and the user has
    provided affirmative consent to the collection and use of such information. Subject to and
    without limiting the foregoing, Developer agrees it will not enable collection or use of credit
    card information, Social Security numbers, driver&#39;s license numbers, dates of birth or
    physical addresses via the Services. Developer further agrees it will not invite any user to be
    a Beta Tester that is under the age of consent as defined under any applicable laws, rules, or
    regulations relating to data collection, including without limitation the Children&#39;s Online
    Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (&quot;COPPA&quot;), the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European
    Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard
    to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing
    Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation or &quot;GDPR&quot;), and all other
    relevant laws and regulations. At all times during the term of this Agreement, Developer shall
    maintain a privacy policy: (a) that is readily accessible to users from its website or within
    its online service (as applicable), (b) that fully and accurately discloses to its users what
    information is collected about its users, and (c) that states that such information is disclosed
    to and processed by third party providers like Crashlytics in the manner contemplated by the
    Services, including, without limitation, disclosure of the use of technology to track users&#39;
    activity and otherwise collect information from users. For Developer&#39;s users in the European
    Union, Developer shall provide such users with clear notice of, and obtain such users&#39;
    consent to, the transfer, storage, and use of their information in the United States and any
    other country where Crashlytics, or any third party service providers acting on its behalf,
    operates, and shall further notify such users that the privacy and data protection laws in some
    of these countries may vary from the laws in the country where such users live. Developer shall
    at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to data collection,
    privacy and security, including without limitation, COPPA, GDPR, and all other such laws and
    regulations. Developer will obtain and maintain any required consents necessary and will comply
    with any other applicable requirements to permit the processing of Developer Data under this
    Agreement.</p>

<p>2.7 Developer Systems. Developer is responsible for providing: (a) all equipment, subscriptions
    and credentials necessary for Crashlytics to receive the Developer Data, and (b) all modems,
    servers, devices, storage, software (other than Software), databases, network and communications
    equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access, or otherwise use the Services at
    its facility (collectively, &quot;Developer Systems&quot;). Developer shall ensure that
    Developer Systems are compatible with the Services and comply with all configurations and
    specifications described in the Documentation.</p>

<p>2.8 Limitations. Crashlytics will not be responsible or liable for any failures in the Services
    or any other problems which are related to: (a) the Developer Data or Developer Systems, or (b)
    any satellite, telecommunications, network or other equipment or service outside of Crashlytics&#39;s
    facilities or control.</p>

<p>2.9 Confidentiality. &quot;Confidential Information&quot; means any information disclosed by one
    party (&quot;Discloser&quot;) to the other party (&quot;Recipient&quot;) that is marked or
    otherwise identified as &quot;confidential&quot; or &quot;proprietary,&quot; or by its nature or
    the circumstances of disclosure should reasonably be understood to be confidential, including
    without limitation, all financial, business or technical information disclosed in relation to
    this Agreement. Except for the specific rights granted by this Agreement, the Recipient may not
    use, copy or disclose any Confidential Information of the Discloser without Discloser&#39;s
    prior written consent, and shall use no less than reasonable care to safeguard Discloser&#39;s
    Confidential Information, including ensuring that Recipient&#39;s employees, contractors and
    agents (&quot;Representatives&quot;)with access to Discloser&#39;s Confidential Information have
    a need to know such Confidential Information for the purposes of this Agreement and are bound by
    confidentiality obligations no less protective of the parties as those set forth herein. The
    foregoing obligations shall not apply to any Confidential Information that Recipient can
    demonstrate is: (a) already known by it without restriction, (b) rightfully furnished to it
    without restriction by a third party not in breach of any obligation to Discloser, (c) generally
    available to the public without breach of this Agreement or (d) independently developed by it
    without reference to or use of any of Discloser&#39;s Confidential Information and without any
    violation of any obligation of this Agreement. Each party shall be responsible for any breach of
    confidentiality by its Representatives, as applicable. Promptly upon Discloser&#39;s request at
    any time, Recipient shall, or in the case of Developer Data shall use reasonable efforts to,
    return all of Discloser&#39;s tangible Confidential Information, permanently erase all
    Confidential Information from any storage media and destroy all information, records, copies,
    summaries, analyses and materials developed therefrom. Nothing herein shall prevent a party from
    disclosing any of the other&#39;s Confidential Information as necessary pursuant to any court
    order or any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation;
    provided, however, prior to any such disclosure, Recipient shall use reasonable efforts to: (i)
    promptly notify Discloser in writing of such requirement to disclose where permitted by law, and
    (ii) cooperate with Discloser in protecting against or minimizing any such disclosure and/or
    obtaining a protective order.</p>

    all intellectual property and other proprietary rights) in and to: (a) feedback, suggestions,
    ideas or other materials and information provided by Beta Testers with respect to any Beta
    Application (&quot;User Feedback&quot;), (b) the Results and (c) Developer Data. Developer
    acknowledges and agrees that the Results will be presented to it in a Report, the Report Format
    of which is Confidential Information and proprietary to Crashlytics. Developer may make a
    reasonable number of copies of the Reports only for its internal purposes in using the
    Results.</p>

    bound. Developer&#39;s sole and exclusive remedy for any and all breaches of this provision is
    the remedy set forth in Section 4.4. Developer represents and warrants that it owns all right,

    IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, CRASHLYTICS AND ITS
    PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, RELATED COMPANIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,
    REPRESENTATIVES, PARTNERS AND LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE &quot;CRASHLYTICS ENTITIES&quot;)
    MAKE NO WARRANTY: (A) THAT THE SERVICES OR RESULTS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE
    UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE OR BUGFREE, (B) REGARDING THE RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, OR PERFORMANCE
    OF THE SERVICES, OR (C) THAT ANY ERRORS IN THE SERVICES CAN OR WILL BE CORRECTED. THE
    CRASHLYTICS ENTITIES HEREBY DISCLAIM (FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR SUPPLIERS) ALL WARRANTIES,
    WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
    ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM ANY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.</p>

<p>4.3 Claims Against Crashlytics. Developer will defend Crashlytics from all third party claims,
    whether actual or alleged (collectively, &quot;Crashlytics Claims&quot;), and will indemnify
    Crashlytics and hold Crashlytics harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs,
    and expenses (including reasonable attorney&#39;s fees) resulting from such Crashlytics Claims
    that arise out of Developer&#39;s: (a) use of the Services, (b) actual or alleged infringement
    or misappropriation of the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, any
    intellectual property rights, privacy rights or publicity rights, and (c) breach of any
    representations and warranties set forth in the Agreement. Developer is solely responsible for
    defending any such Crashlytics Claims, subject to Crashlytics&#39;s right to participate with
    counsel of its own choosing, and for payment of all judgments, settlements, damages, losses,
    liabilities, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees, resulting from such
    Claims against Crashlytics, provided that Developer will not agree to any settlement related to
    any such Crashlytics Claims without Crashlytics&#39;s prior express written consent regardless
    of whether or not such settlement releases Crashlytics from any obligation or liability. If
    Developer uses the Services in an official capacity as an employee or representative of a United
    States federal, state, or local government entity and is legally unable to accept this
    indemnification provision, then it does not apply to such entity, but only to the extent
    required by applicable law.</p>

<p>4.4 Claims Against Developer. Crashlytics will defend the Developer from all third party claims,
    actions, suits, or proceedings, whether actual or alleged (collectively, &quot;Developer Claims&quot;),
    and will indemnify Developer and hold Developer harmless from any and all losses, liabilities,
    damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney&#39;s fees) resulting from such
    Developer Claims, that arise out of an allegation that the Services, when used as expressly
    permitted by this Agreement, infringes the intellectual property rights of such third party.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, Crashlytics will have no obligation under this Section 4.4 or
    otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon: (a) any use of the Services not
    expressly permitted under this Agreement; (b) any use of the Services in combination with
    products, equipment, software, or data not made available by Crashlytics if such infringement
    would have been avoided without the combination with such other products, equipment, software,
    or data; (c) any modification of the Services by any person other than Crashlytics or its
    authorized agents or subcontractors; or (d) any claim not clearly based on the Services itself.
    This Section 4.4 states Crashlytics&#39;s entire liability and Developer&#39;s sole and
    exclusive remedy for all third party claims.</p>

<p>4.5 Procedure. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on the party seeking indemnification:
    (a) promptly notifying the other party in writing of such claim; (b) giving the other party sole
    control of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations; and (c) cooperating and,
    at the other party&#39;s request and expense, assisting in such defense. Neither party may make
    any public announcement of any claim, defense or settlement without the other party&#39;s prior
    written approval. The indemnifying party may not settle, compromise or resolve a claim without
    the consent of the indemnified party, if such settlement, compromise or resolution (i) causes or
    requires an admission or finding of guilt against the indemnified party, (i) imposes any
    monetary damages against the indemnified party, or (iii) does not fully release the indemnified
    party from liability with respect to the claim.</p>

<p>4.6 Limitation of Liability.</p>

<p>(a) IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
    EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
    AGREEMENT, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS, PROFITS, OR GOODWILL OR
    FOR INTERRUPTION, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR NETWORKS.</p>

<p>(b) IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY&#39;S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS UNDER THIS
    AGREEMENT EXCEED FIFTY ($50.00) DOLLARS (USD).</p>

<p>(c) THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO BREACHES OF CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS OR FOR
    MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND SHALL APPLY
    NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN.</p>

<p>THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS SHALL APPLY TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS,
    REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. Some states do not allow the exclusion or
    limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not
    apply to You. INSOFAR AS APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ANY LIMITATION ON LIABILITY HEREIN, THE
    PARTIES AGREE THAT SUCH LIMITATION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY MODIFIED, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT SO AS
    TO MAKE THE LIMITATION COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

<p>SECTION 5. TERM AND TERMINATION</p>

    are approved to register for the Services, and continue until terminated as set forth herein (&quot;Term&quot;).

    constitutes the entire agreement, and supersede all prior negotiations, understandings, or
    agreements (oral or written), between the parties about the subject matter of this
    Agreement.</p>

<p>6.2 Waivers, Consents and Amendments. No waiver, consent, or modification of this Agreement shall
    bind the Crashlytics Entities unless in writing and signed by Crashlytics. Crashlytics may amend
    this Agreement from time to time. If we make a change to this Agreement that, in our sole

    crashlytics.com, or otherwise through the Services. If you do not agree to the modified terms,
    you shall notify Crashlytics in writing within thirty (30) days, after which your right to
    access and use the Services shall immediately terminate and the Crashlytics Entities shall have
    no further responsibility or liability to you. The failure of either party to enforce its rights
    under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver of such
    rights.</p>

<p>6.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or
    unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so
    that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</p>

<p>6.4 Governing Law and Disputes. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
    with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.</p>

<p>(a) Except as set forth in Section 6.4(b) below, all claims arising out of or relating to this
    Agreement or the Services (&quot;Disputes&quot;) will be governed by California law, excluding
    California&#39;s conflict of laws rules, and all Disputes will be litigated exclusively in the
    federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and You and Crashlytics consent
    to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>

<p>(b) If Your principal place of business (for entities) or place of residence (for individuals) is
    in any country within APAC (other than Australia, Japan, New Zealand or Singapore) or Latin
    America, this Section 6.4(b) will apply instead of Section 6.4(a) above. ALL DISPUTES (AS
    DEFINED ABOVE) WILL BE GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA LAW, EXCLUDING CALIFORNIA&#39;S CONFLICT OF LAWS
    RULES.The parties will try in good faith to settle any Dispute within 30 days after the Dispute
    arises. If the Dispute is not resolved within 30 days, it must be resolved by arbitration by the
    American Arbitration Association&#39;s International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance
    with its Expedited Commercial Rules in force as of the date of this Agreement (&quot;Rules&quot;).
    The parties will mutually select one arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in English in
    Santa Clara County, California, USA. Either party may apply to any competent court for
    injunctive relief necessary to protect its rights pending resolution of the arbitration. The
    arbitrator may order equitable or injunctive relief consistent with the remedies and limitations
    in this Agreement. Subject to the confidentiality requirements in of this Agreement, either
    party may petition any competent court to issue any order necessary to protect that party&#39;s
    rights or property; this petition will not be considered a violation or waiver of this governing
    law and arbitration section and will not affect the arbitrator&#39;s powers, including the power
    to review the judicial decision. The parties stipulate that the courts of Santa Clara County,
    California, USA, are competent to grant any order under this subsection. The arbitral award will
    be final and binding on the parties and its execution may be presented in any competent court,
    including any court with jurisdiction over either party or any of its property. Any arbitration
    proceeding conducted in accordance with this section will be considered Confidential Information
    under this Agreement&#39;s confidentiality section, including: (i) the existence of, (ii) any
    information disclosed during, and (iii) any oral communications or documents related to the
    arbitration proceedings. The parties may also disclose the information described in this section
    to a competent court as may be necessary to file any order under this section or execute any
    arbitral decision, but the parties must request that those judicial proceedings be conducted in
    camera (in private). The parties will pay the arbitrator&#39;s fees, the arbitrator&#39;s
    appointed experts&#39; fees and expenses, and the arbitration center&#39;s administrative
    expenses in accordance with the Rules. In its final decision, the arbitrator will determine the
    non-prevailing party&#39;s obligation to reimburse the amount paid in advance by the prevailing
    party for these fees. Each party will bear its own lawyers&#39; and experts&#39; fees and
    expenses, regardless of the arbitrator&#39;s final decision.</p>

<p>6.5 Force Majeure. In the event that either party is prevented from performing, or is unable to
    perform, any of its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) due to any
    cause beyond its reasonable control, the affected party shall give written notice thereof to the
    other party and its performance shall be extended for the period of delay or inability to
    perform due to such occurrence.</p>

    shall be in English, and deemed to have been received when they are hand delivered, or five
    business days after their mailing, or upon confirmed electronic transmission or confirmed
    facsimile transmission.</p>

    transferred or delegated, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law,
    contract, merger (whether Developer is the surviving or disappearing entity), stock or asset
    sale, consolidation, dissolution, through government action or otherwise, by Developer without
    Crashlytics&#39;s prior written consent. Any assignment or transfer in violation of the
    foregoing shall automatically be null and void, and Crashlytics may immediately terminate this
    Agreement upon such an attempt. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit
    of, any permitted successors, representatives, and permitted assigns of the parties hereto.</p>

<p>6.8 Independent Contractors. The parties shall be independent contractors under this Agreement,
    and nothing herein will constitute either party as the employer, employee, agent, or
    representative of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any

    means either (i) Google Commerce Limited (&quot;GCL&quot;), a company incorporated under the
    laws of Ireland, with offices at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, if Customer has

    made and entered into by and between Customer and Google New Zealand Limited, with offices at
    PWC Tower, Level 27, 188 Quay Street, Auckland, New Zealand 1010 , as an authorized reseller in
    New Zealand of the Services and &quot;Google&quot; means Google Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. and/or
    its affiliates (including Google New Zealand Limited) as the context requires.</p>

<p>This Agreement is effective as of the date Customer clicks to accept the Agreement (the &quot;Effective
    Date&quot;). If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that: (i) you
    have full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand
    this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement. If you do not
    have the legal authority to bind Customer, please do not click to accept. This Agreement governs
    Customer&#39;s access to and use of the Service. For an offline variant of this Agreement, you
    may contact Google for more information.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Provision of the Services.</li>
</ol>

<p>1.1 Services Use. Subject to this Agreement, during the Term, Customer may: (a) use the Services,
    (b) integrate the Services into any Application that has material value independent of the
    Services, and (c) use any Software provided by Google as part of the Services. Customer may not
    sublicense or transfer these rights except as permitted under the Assignment section of the
    Agreement.</p>

<p>1.2 Console. Google will provide the Services to Customer. As part of receiving the Services,
    Customer will have access to the Admin Console, through which Customer may administer the
    Services.</p>

<p>1.3 Facilities. All facilities used to store and process an Application and Customer Data will
    adhere to reasonable security standards no less protective than the security standards at
    facilities where Google processes and stores its own information of a similar type. Google has
    implemented at least industry standard systems and procedures to (i) ensure the security and
    confidentiality of an Application and Customer Data, (ii) protect against anticipated threats or
    hazards to the security or integrity of an Application and Customer Data, and (iii) protect
    against unauthorized access to or use of an Application and Customer Data.</p>

<p>1.4 Data Location. Customer may select where certain Customer Data will be stored (&quot;Data
    Location Selection&quot;), and Google will store it there in accordance with the Service
    Specific Terms. If a Data Location Selection is not covered by the Service Specific Terms (or a
    Data Location Selection is not made by Customer with respect to any Customer Data), Google may
    process and store the Customer Data anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. By using
    the Services, Customer consents to this processing and storage of Customer Data. Under this
    Agreement, Google is merely a data processor.</p>

<p>1.5 Accounts. Customer must have an Account and a Token (if applicable) to use the Services, and
    is responsible for the information it provides to create the Account, the security of the Token
    and its passwords for the Account, and for any use of its Account and the Token. If Customer
    becomes aware of any unauthorized use of its password, its Account or the Token, Customer will
    notify Google as promptly as possible. Google has no obligation to provide Customer multiple
    Tokens or Accounts.</p>

<p>1.6 New Applications and Services. Google may: (i) make new applications, tools, features or
    functionality available from time to time through the Services and (ii) add new services to the
    &quot;Services&quot; definition from time to time (by adding them at the URL set forth under
    that definition), the use of which may be contingent upon Customer&#39;s agreement to additional
    terms.</p>

<p>1.7 Modifications.</p>

<p>a. To the Services. Google may make commercially reasonable updates to the Services from time to
    time. If Google makes a material change to the Services, Google will inform Customer, provided
    that Customer has subscribed with Google to be informed about such change.</p>

<p>b. To the Agreement. Google may make changes to this Agreement, including pricing (and any linked
    documents) from time to time. Unless otherwise noted by Google, material changes to the
    Agreement will become effective 30 days after they are posted, except if the changes apply to
    new functionality in which case they will be effective immediately. Google will provide at least
    90 days&#39; advance notice for materially adverse changes to any SLAs by either: (i) sending an
    email to Customer&#39;s primary point of contact; (ii) posting a notice in the Admin Console; or
    (iii) posting a notice to the applicable SLA webpage. If Customer does not agree to the revised
    Agreement, please stop using the Services. Google will post any modification to this Agreement
    to the Terms URL.</p>

<p>c. To the Data Processing and Security Terms. Google may only change the Data Processing and
    Security Terms where such change is required to comply with applicable law, applicable
    regulation, court order, or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or agency, where such
    change is expressly permitted by the Data Processing and Security Terms, or where such
    change:</p>

<p>(i) is commercially reasonable;</p>

<p>(ii) does not result in a degradation of the overall security of the Services;</p>

<p>(iii) does not expand the scope of or remove any restrictions on Google&#39;s processing of
    Customer Personal Data, as described in Section 5.2 (Scope of Processing) of the Data Processing
    and Security Terms; and</p>

<p>(iv) does not otherwise have a material adverse impact on Customer&#39;s rights under the Data
    Processing and Security Terms.</p>

<p>If Google makes a material change to the Data Processing and Security Terms in accordance with
    this Section, Google will post the modification to the URL containing those terms.</p>

<p>1.8 Service Specific Terms and Data Processing and Security Terms. The Service Specific Terms and
    Data Processing and Security Terms are incorporated by this reference into the Agreement.</p>

<ol start="2">
    <li>Payment Terms.</li>
</ol>

<p>2.1 Free Quota. Certain Services are provided to Customer without charge up to the Fee Threshold,
    as applicable.</p>

<p>2.2 Online Billing. At the end of the applicable Fee Accrual Period, Google will issue an
    electronic bill to Customer for all charges accrued above the Fee Threshold based on (i)
    Customer&#39;s use of the Services during the previous Fee Accrual Period (including, if any,
    the relevant Fee for TSS set forth in the Fees definition below); (ii) any Reserved Units
    selected; (iii) any Committed Purchases selected; and/or (iv) any Package Purchases selected.
    For use above the Fee Threshold, Customer will be responsible for all Fees up to the amount set
    in the Account and will pay all Fees in the currency set forth in the invoice. If Customer
    elects to pay by credit card, debit card, or other non-invoiced form of payment, Google will
    charge (and Customer will pay) all Fees immediately at the end of the Fee Accrual Period. If
    Customer elects to pay by invoice (and Google agrees), all Fees are due as set forth in the
    invoice. Customer&#39;s obligation to pay all Fees is non-cancellable. Google&#39;s measurement
    of Customer&#39;s use of the Services is final. Google has no obligation to provide multiple
    bills. Payments made via wire transfer must include the bank information provided by Google. If
    Customer has entered into the Agreement with GCL, Google may collect payments via Google Payment
    Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales with offices at Belgrave House, 76
    Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 9TQ, United Kingdom.</p>

<p>2.3 Taxes. (a) Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and Customer will pay Google for the
    Services without any reduction for Taxes. If Google is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the
    Taxes will be invoiced to Customer, unless Customer provides Google with a timely and valid tax
    exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. In some states the sales
    tax is due on the total purchase price at the time of sale and must be invoiced and collected at
    the time of the sale. If Customer is required by law to withhold any Taxes from its payments to
    Google, Customer must provide Google with an official tax receipt or other appropriate
    documentation to support such withholding. If under the applicable tax legislation the Services
    are subject to local VAT and the Customer is required to make a withholding of local VAT from
    amounts payable to Google, the value of Services calculated in accordance with the above
    procedure will be increased (grossed up) by the Customer for the respective amount of local VAT
    and the grossed up amount will be regarded as a VAT inclusive price. Local VAT amount withheld
    from the VAT-inclusive price will be remitted to the applicable local tax entity by the Customer
    and Customer will ensure that Google will receives payment for its services for the net amount
    as would otherwise be due (the VAT inclusive price less the local VAT withheld and remitted to
    applicable tax authority).</p>

<p>(b) If required under applicable law, Customer will provide Google with applicable tax
    identification information that Google may require to ensure its compliance with applicable tax
    regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions. Customer will be liable to pay (or
    reimburse Google for) any taxes, interest, penalties or fines arising out of any mis-declaration
    by the Customer.</p>

<p>2.4 Invoice Disputes &amp; Refunds. Any invoice disputes must be submitted prior to the payment
    due date. If the parties determine that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to Google,
    Google will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the
    incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If the disputed invoice has not yet been paid, Google
    will apply the credit memo amount to the disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for
    paying the resulting net balance due on that invoice. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
    Customer waives all claims relating to Fees unless claimed within sixty days after charged (this
    does not affect any Customer rights with its credit card issuer). Refunds (if any) are at the
    discretion of Google and will only be in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this
    Agreement obligates Google to extend credit to any party.</p>

<p>2.5 Delinquent Payments; Suspension. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per
    month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in
    full. Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys&#39; fees)
    incurred by Google in collecting such delinquent amounts. If Customer is late on payment for the
    Services, Google may Suspend the Services or terminate the Agreement for breach pursuant to
    Section 9.2.</p>

<p>2.6 No Purchase Order Number Required. For clarity, Customer is obligated to pay all applicable
    Fees without any requirement for Google to provide a purchase order number on Google&#39;s
    invoice (or otherwise).</p>

<ol start="3">
    <li>Customer Obligations.</li>
</ol>

<p>3.1 Compliance. Customer is solely responsible for its Applications, Projects, and Customer Data
    and for making sure its Applications, Projects, and Customer Data comply with the AUP. Google
    reserves the right to review the Application, Project, and Customer Data for compliance with the
    AUP. Customer is responsible for ensuring all Customer End Users comply with Customer&#39;s
    obligations under the AUP, the Service Specific Terms, and the restrictions in Sections 3.3 and
    3.5 below.</p>

<p>3.2 Privacy. Customer will obtain and maintain any required consents necessary to permit the
    processing of Customer Data under this Agreement.</p>

<p>3.3 Restrictions. Customer will not, and will not allow third parties under its control to: (a)
    copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble,
    or otherwise attempt to extract any or all of the source code of the Services (subject to
    Section 3.4 below and except to the extent such restriction is expressly prohibited by
    applicable law); (b) use the Services for High Risk Activities; (c) sublicense, resell, or
    distribute any or all of the Services separate from any integrated Application; (d) create

    avoid incurring Fees or exceed usage limits or quotas; (e) unless otherwise set forth in the
    Service Specific Terms, use the Services to operate or enable any telecommunications service or
    in connection with any Application that allows Customer End Users to place calls or to receive
    calls from any public switched telephone network; or (f) process or store any Customer Data that
    is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the Department of
    State. Unless otherwise specified in writing by Google, Google does not intend uses of the
    Services to create obligations under HIPAA, and makes no representations that the Services
    satisfy HIPAA requirements. If Customer is (or becomes) a Covered Entity or Business Associate,
    as defined in HIPAA, Customer will not use the Services for any purpose or in any manner
    involving Protected Health Information (as defined in HIPAA) unless Customer has received prior
    written consent to such use from Google.</p>

<p>3.4 Third Party Components. Third party components (which may include open source software) of
    the Services may be subject to separate license agreements. To the limited extent a third party
    license expressly supersedes this Agreement, that third party license governs Customer&#39;s use
    of that third party component.</p>

<p>3.5 Documentation. Google may provide Documentation for Customer&#39;s use of the Services. The
    Documentation may specify restrictions (e.g. attribution or HTML restrictions) on how the
    Applications may be built or the Services may be used and Customer will comply with any such
    restrictions specified.</p>

<p>3.6 Copyright Policy. Google provides information to help copyright holders manage their
    intellectual property online, but Google cannot determine whether something is being used
    legally or not without their input. Google responds to notices of alleged copyright infringement
    and terminates accounts of repeat infringers according to applicable copyright laws including in
    particular the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If Customer thinks
    somebody is violating Customer&#39;s or Customer End Users&#39; copyrights and wants to notify
    Google, Customer can find information about submitting notices, and Google&#39;s policy about
    responding to notices at http://www.google.com/dmca.html.</p>

<ol start="4">
    <li>Suspension.</li>
</ol>

<p>4.1 AUP Violations. If Google becomes aware that Customer&#39;s or any Customer End User&#39;s
    use of the Services violates the AUP, Google will give Customer notice of the violation by
    requesting that Customer correct the violation. If Customer fails to correct the violation
    within 24 hours of Google&#39;s request, then Google may Suspend all or part of Customer&#39;s
    use of the Services until the violation is corrected.</p>

<p>4.2 Other Suspension. Notwithstanding Section 4.1 (AUP Violations) Google may immediately Suspend
    all or part of Customer&#39;s use of the Services if: (a) Google believes Customer&#39;s or any
    Customer End User&#39;s use of the Services could adversely impact the Services, other customers&#39;
    or their end users&#39; use of the Services, or the Google network or servers used to provide
    the Services, which may include use of the Services for cryptocurrency mining without Google&#39;s
    prior written approval; (b) there is suspected unauthorized third-party access to the Services;
    (c) Google believes it is required to Suspend immediately to comply with applicable law; or (d)
    Customer is in breach of Section 3.3 (Restrictions). Google will lift any such Suspension when
    the circumstances giving rise to the Suspension have been resolved. At Customer&#39;s request,
    unless prohibited by applicable law, Google will notify Customer of the basis for the Suspension
    as soon as is reasonably possible.</p>

<ol start="5">
    <li>Intellectual Property Rights; Use of Customer Data; Feedback; Benchmarking.</li>
</ol>

<p>5.1 Intellectual Property Rights. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement
    does not grant either party any rights, implied or otherwise, to the other&#39;s content or any
    of the other&#39;s intellectual property. As between the parties, Customer owns all Intellectual
    Property Rights in Customer Data and the Application or Project (if applicable), and Google owns
    all Intellectual Property Rights in the Services and Software.</p>

<p>5.2 Use of Customer Data. Google will not access or use Customer Data, except as necessary to
    provide the Services and TSS to Customer.</p>

<p>5.3 Customer Feedback. If Customer provides Google Feedback about the Services, then Google may
    use that information without obligation to Customer, and Customer hereby irrevocably assigns to
    Google all right, title, and interest in that Feedback.</p>

<p>5.4 Benchmarking. Customer may not publicly disclose directly or through a third party the
    results of any comparative or compatibility testing, benchmarking, or evaluation (each, a &quot;Test&quot;)
    of the Services, unless the disclosure includes all information necessary for Google or a third
    party to replicate the Test. If Customer conducts, or directs a third party to conduct, a Test
    of the Services and publicly discloses the results directly or through a third party, then
    Google (or a Google-directed third party) may conduct Tests of any publicly available products
    or services provided by Customer and publicly disclose the results of any such Test (which
    disclosure will include all information necessary for Customer or a third party to replicate the
    Test). To the extent this Section 5.4 conflicts with any other Customer product or service
    terms, this Section 5.4 will govern.</p>

<ol start="6">
    <li>Technical Support Services</li>
</ol>

<p>6.1 By Customer. Customer is responsible for technical support of its Applications and
    Projects.</p>

<p>6.2 By Google. Subject to payment of applicable support Fees, Google will provide TSS to Customer
    during the Term in accordance with the TSS Guidelines. Certain TSS levels include a minimum
    recurring Fee as described in the &quot;Fees&quot; definition below. If Customer downgrades its
    TSS level during any calendar month, Google may continue to provide TSS at the same level and
    TSS Fees before the downgrade for the remainder of that month.</p>

<ol start="7">
    <li>Deprecation of Services</li>
</ol>

<p>7.1 Discontinuance of Services. Subject to Section 7.2, Google may discontinue any Services or
    any portion or feature for any reason at any time without liability to Customer.</p>

<p>7.2 Deprecation Policy. Google will announce if it intends to discontinue or make backwards
    incompatible changes to the Services specified at the URL in the next sentence. Google will use
    commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate those Services versions and features
    identified at https://cloud.google.com/terms/deprecation without these changes for at least one
    year after that announcement, unless (as Google determines in its reasonable good faith
    judgment):</p>

<p>(i) required by law or third party relationship (including if there is a change in applicable law
    or relationship), or</p>

<p>(ii) doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical
    burden.</p>

<p>The above policy is the &quot;Deprecation Policy.&quot;</p>

<ol start="8">
    <li>Confidential Information.</li>
</ol>

<p>8.1 Obligations. The recipient will not disclose the Confidential Information, except to
    Affiliates, employees, agents or professional advisors who need to know it and who have agreed
    in writing (or in the case of professional advisors are otherwise bound) to keep it
    confidential. The recipient will ensure that those people and entities use the received
    Confidential Information only to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this Agreement,
    while using reasonable care to keep it confidential.</p>

<p>8.2 Required Disclosure. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, the
    recipient may also disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable Legal
    Process; provided that the recipient uses commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) promptly
    notify the other party of such disclosure before disclosing; and (ii) comply with the other
    party&#39;s reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose the disclosure. Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, subsections (i) and (ii) above will not apply if the recipient determines that
    complying with (i) and (ii) could: (a) result in a violation of Legal Process; (b) obstruct a
    governmental investigation; and/or (c) lead to death or serious physical harm to an individual.
    As between the parties, Customer is responsible for responding to all third party requests
    concerning its use and Customer End Users&#39; use of the Services.</p>

    days after receipt of written notice; (ii) the other party ceases its business operations or
    becomes subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within ninety

    portion of the Services or Projects, if Customer meets any of the conditions in Section 9.2(i),
    (ii), and/or (iii).</p>

<p>9.3 Termination for Inactivity.</p>

<p>Google reserves the right to terminate the provision of the Service(s) to a Project upon 30 days
    advance notice if, for a period of 60 days (i) Customer has not accessed the Admin Console or

    such Service(s).</p>

<p>9.4 Termination for Convenience. Customer may stop using the Services at any time. Customer may
    terminate this Agreement for its convenience at any time on prior written notice and upon
    termination, must cease use of the applicable Services. Google may terminate this Agreement for

<p>9.5 Effect of Termination. If the Agreement is terminated, then: (i) the rights granted by one
    party to the other will immediately cease; (ii) all Fees owed by Customer to Google are
    immediately due upon receipt of the final electronic bill; (iii) Customer will delete the

        Google through the process specified in the Trademark Guidelines. Google may include
        Customer&#39;s name or Brand Features in a list of Google customers, online or in
        promotional materials. Google may also verbally reference Customer as a customer of the
        Services. Neither party needs approval if it is repeating a public statement that is
        substantially similar to a previously-approved public statement. Any use of a party&#39;s
        Brand Features will inure to the benefit of the party holding Intellectual Property Rights
        to those Brand Features. A party may revoke the other party&#39;s right to use its Brand
        Features under this Section with written notice to the other party and a reasonable period
        to stop the use.
    </li>
    <li>Representations and Warranties. Each party represents and warrants that: (a) it has full
        power and authority to enter into the Agreement; and (b) it will comply with all laws and

    INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF THE PARTY

<p>13.2 Limitation on Amount of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,

    EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.</p>

<p>13.3 Exceptions to Limitations. These limitations of liability do not apply to violations of a
    party&#39;s Intellectual Property Rights by the other party, indemnification obligations, or
    Customer&#39;s payment obligations.</p>

<ol start="14">
    <li>Indemnification.</li>
</ol>

<p>14.1 By Customer. Unless prohibited by applicable law, Customer will defend and indemnify Google
    and its Affiliates against Indemnified Liabilities in any Third-Party Legal Proceeding to the
    extent arising from: (i) any Application, Project, Instance, Customer Data or Customer Brand
    Features; or (ii) Customer&#39;s, or Customer End Users&#39;, use of the Services in violation
    of the AUP.</p>

<p>14.2 By Google. Google will defend and indemnify Customer and its Affiliates against Indemnified
    Liabilities in any Third-Party Legal Proceeding to the extent arising solely from an Allegation
    that use of (a) Google&#39;s technology used to provide the Services or (b) any Google Brand
    Feature infringes or misappropriates the third party&#39;s patent, copyright, trade secret, or
    trademark.</p>

<p>14.3 Exclusions. This Section 14 will not apply to the extent the underlying Allegation arises
    from:</p>

<p>a. the indemnified party&#39;s breach of this Agreement;</p>

<p>b. modifications to the indemnifying party&#39;s technology or Brand Features by anyone other
    than the indemnifying party;</p>

<p>c. combination of the indemnifying party&#39;s technology or Brand Features with materials not
    provided by the indemnifying party; or</p>

<p>d. use of non-current or unsupported versions of the Services or Brand Features;</p>

<p>14.4 Conditions. Sections 14.1 and 14.2 will apply only to the extent:</p>

<p>a. The indemnified party has promptly notified the indemnifying party in writing of any
    Allegation(s) that preceded the Third-Party Legal Proceeding and cooperates reasonably with the
    indemnifying party to resolve the Allegation(s) and Third-Party Legal Proceeding. If breach of
    this Section 14.4(a) prejudices the defense of the Third-Party Legal Proceeding, the
    indemnifying party&#39;s obligations under Section 14.1 or 14.2 (as applicable) will be reduced
    in proportion to the prejudice.</p>

<p>b. The indemnified party tenders sole control of the indemnified portion of the Third-Party Legal
    Proceeding to the indemnifying party, subject to the following: (i) the indemnified party may
    appoint its own non-controlling counsel, at its own expense; and (ii) any settlement requiring
    the indemnified party to admit liability, pay money, or take (or refrain from taking) any
    action, will require the indemnified party&#39;s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably
    withheld, conditioned, or delayed.</p>

<p>14.5 Remedies.</p>

<p>a. If Google reasonably believes the Services might infringe a third party&#39;s Intellectual
    Property Rights, then Google may, at its sole option and expense: (a) procure the right for
    Customer to continue using the Services; (b) modify the Services to make them non-infringing
    without materially reducing their functionality; or (c) replace the Services with a
    non-infringing, functionally equivalent alternative.</p>

<p>b. If Google does not believe the remedies in Section 14.5(a) are commercially reasonable, then
    Google may Suspend or terminate Customer&#39;s use of the impacted Services.</p>

<p>14.6 Sole Rights and Obligations. Without affecting either party&#39;s termination rights, this
    Section 14 states the parties&#39; only rights and obligations under this Agreement for any
